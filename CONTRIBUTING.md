# Contributing Policy

Holiday Optimizer is a personal project that I publish for transparency. The code is available to read and learn from, but development happens privately.

## What this means

- Pull requests, feature suggestions, and unsolicited patches will be closed without merge.
- Please do not fork, rebrand, or redeploy the project without written permission (see the usage policy in the README).
- If you spot a bug or have a question, you can raise a discussion or contact me directly, but any fixes will be authored by me.

## How to support the project

- Star the repository if you find it useful.
- Share feedback about the experience or results; it helps guide future improvements.

Thanks for respecting these boundaries and for taking an interest in the project!
