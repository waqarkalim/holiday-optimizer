# Holiday Optimizer

A web application for optimizing Paid Time Off (PTO) usage.

## Overview

Holiday Optimizer helps users maximize their time off by intelligently planning PTO days around public and company holidays. By inputting your available PTO and selecting your location, the application generates an optimized schedule suggesting the best days to take off to create longer breaks throughout the year.

## Features

- Input your total available Paid Time Off (PTO) days.
- Select your country (and region/province, where applicable) to automatically fetch public holidays for a chosen year.
- Add custom company-specific non-working days.
- Choose an optimization strategy (e.g., maximize long weekends, distribute evenly).
- Generate a visual schedule highlighting suggested PTO days and resulting time-off blocks.
- Plan for the current or upcoming year.
- Responsive design for use on various devices.
